Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometerelerometer and gyroscopescope 3-axial raw signals taccelerometer-XYZ and tgyroscope-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the accelerometereleration signal was then separated into body and gravity accelerometereleration signals (timeBodyaccelerometer-XYZ and tGravityaccelerometer-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear accelerometereleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyaccelerometerJerk-XYZ and timeBodygyroscopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitudenitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyaccelerometermagnitude, tGravityaccelerometermagnitude, timeBodyaccelerometerJerkmagnitude, timeBodygyroscopemagnitude, timeBodygyroscopeJerkmagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyaccelerometer-XYZ, frequencyBodyaccelerometerJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodygyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyaccelerometerJerkmagnitude, frequencyBodygyroscopemagnitude, frequencyBodygyroscopeJerkmagnitude. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
